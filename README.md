# Real-Time Chat App with React, Node, Socket.io, and HarperDB

Tools used to Build this App:
- **Frontend**: React (A frontend JavaScript framework for building interactibe applications)
- **Backend**: Node and Express (Express is very popular NodeJS framework that allows us to easily create APIs and backends)
- **Database**: HarperDB (a data + application platform that allows you to query data using either SQL or NoSQL. HarperDB also has a built-in API, saving us from having to write a lot of backend code)
- **Realtime Communication**: Socket.io
